*** FooBar question***
Suppose you are given the following code:

class FooBar {
  public void foo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("foo");
    }
  }

  public void bar() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("bar");
    }
  }
}
The same instance of FooBar will be passed to two different threads:

thread A will call foo(), while
thread B will call bar().
Modify the given program to output "foobar" n times.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: "foobar"
Explanation: There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar().
"foobar" is being output 1 time.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: "foobarfoobar"
Explanation: "foobar" is being output 2 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000


*** ZeroEvenOdd question ***

You have a function printNumber that can be called with an integer parameter and prints it to the console.

For example, calling printNumber(7) prints 7 to the console.
You are given an instance of the class ZeroEvenOdd that has three functions: zero, even, and odd. The same instance of ZeroEvenOdd will be passed to three different threads:

Thread A: calls zero() that should only output 0's.
Thread B: calls even() that should only output even numbers.
Thread C: calls odd() that should only output odd numbers.
Modify the given class to output the series "010203040506..." where the length of the series must be 2n.

Implement the ZeroEvenOdd class:

ZeroEvenOdd(int n) Initializes the object with the number n that represents the numbers that should be printed.
void zero(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one zero.
void even(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one even number.
void odd(printNumber) Calls printNumber to output one odd number.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: "0102"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously.
One of them calls zero(), the other calls even(), and the last one calls odd().
"0102" is the correct output.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: "0102030405"

*** H2O Problem ***

There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.

There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.
We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

 

Example 1:

Input: water = "HOH"
Output: "HHO"
Explanation: "HOH" and "OHH" are also valid answers.
Example 2:

Input: water = "OOHHHH"
Output: "HHOHHO"
Explanation: "HOHHHO", "OHHHHO", "HHOHOH", "HOHHOH", "OHHHOH", "HHOOHH", "HOHOHH" and "OHHOHH" are also valid answers.
 

Constraints:

3 * n == water.length
1 <= n <= 20
water[i] is either 'H' or 'O'.
There will be exactly 2 * n 'H' in water.
There will be exactly n 'O' in water.


 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
